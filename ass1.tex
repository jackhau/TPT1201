\section{Abstract}
The evolution of science and technology creates a new generation of the access control system, known as digital access control system. A digital access control system allows users to access a premise using an access card. If the access passcode in the access card matches with the access passcode stored in the control system, the door will be unlocked and the user can gain access to his premise. Therefore, in this paper, their proposed system utilizes near field communication smartphone and stego-photo to overcome the disadvantage exhibited by the access control system using the access card.
\section{Problem Solved}
If the access card access password matches the password stored in the access control system, the door will unlock, and the user has access to his premises.
Once the access card is lost, anyone who is in the possession of the card could easily enter the premise illegally.
