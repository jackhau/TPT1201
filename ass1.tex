\section{Abstract}
The evolution of science and technology creates a new generation of the access control system, known as digital access control system. A digital access control system allows users to access a premise using an access card. If the access passcode in the access card matches with the access passcode stored in the control system, the door will be unlocked and the user can gain access to his premise. Therefore, in this paper, their proposed system utilizes near field communication smartphone and stego-photo to overcome the disadvantage exhibited by the access control system using the access card.
